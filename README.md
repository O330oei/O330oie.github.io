The idea is for the website to contain blog posts, along with visualizations of
math / graphics / programming.

The former has been semi-forced thanks to GSoC, as for the latter, it remains
to be seen. I'm hopeful, though :)

# Ideas I stumble onto

# Grobner bases: why and how?

The question a Grobner basis allows us to answer is this: can the polynomial
$p(x, y) = xy^2 + y$ be factorized in terms of $a(x, y) = xy + 1, b(x, y) = y^2 - 1$,
such that $p(x, y) = f(x, y) a(x, y) + g(x, y) b(x, y)$ for some _arbitrary_ polynomials
$f(x, y), g(x, y) \in R[x, y]$.

One might imagine, "well, I'll divide and see what happens!" Now, there are two
routes to go down:

- $xy^2 + y = y(xy + 1) = y a(x, y) + 0 b(x, y)$. Well, problem solved?
- $xy^2 + y = xy^2 - x + x + y = x (y^2 - 1) + x + y = x b(x, y) + (x + y)$. Now what? we're stuck, and we can't apply `a(x, y)`!

So, clearly, the _order_ in which we perform of factorization / division starts
to matter! Ideally, we want an algorithm which is _not sensitive_ to the order
in which we choose to apply these changes. $x^2 + 1$.



An alternative viewpoint of asking "can this be factorized", is to ask
"can we look at the factorization as a rewrite rule"? For this perspective,
notice that "factorizing" in terms of $xy + 1$ is the same as being
able to set $xy = -1$, and then have the polynomial collapse to zero.
(For the more algebraic minded, this relates to the fact that $R[x] / p(x) \sim R(\text{roots of p})$

# Lie bracket versus torsion


![torsion-vs-parallel-transport](static/lie-bracket-versus-torsion.png)

This picture _finally_ made the difference between these two things clear.
The lie bracket moves along the _flow_, while the torsion moves along
_parallel transport_. 

This is why the sides of the parallelogram that measure torsion form,
well, a parallelogram: we set them up using parallel transport.

On the other hand, the lie bracket measures the actual failure of the parallelogram
from being formed.

# [Blog post: Weekend paper replication of STOKE, the stochastic superoptimizer](https://github.com/bollu/blaze/blob/master/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb)

Click the title to go to the post. We replicate the `STOKE` paper in haskell,
to implement a superoptimiser based on MCMC methods.

# Collapsing `BlockId`, `Label`, `Unique`: 

We have this hiearchy of `BlockId`, `Label`, and `Unique` that can be
collapsed. 


# Spatial partitioning data structures in molecular dynamics

[Cell lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_lists) and
[Verlet lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_list)

appear to be version of spatial hierarchical data structures for fast
interaction computation. Apparently, multipole expansions are not useful
in this case since multipole expansions are useful to take into account
long range effects, but not short range effects.

# Representing CPS in LLVM using the `@coro.*` intrinsics

This is part of a larger thread --- [Adding CPS call support to LLVM](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2017-April/112212.html) where there is a large discussion on the correct design of how to teach LLVM about CPS.

Gor Nishanov proided the above example of encoding CPS using the llvm `coro` instructions.

# Bug in the LLVM code generator: Lowering of `MO_Add2` and `MO_AddWordC`

[Both of these are lowered the same way](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/blob/bf73419518ca550e85188616f860961c7e2a336b/compiler/llvmGen/LlvmCodeGen/CodeGen.hs#L817),
but they should be different. 

In particular, `GHC.Prim` explains:
- [`AddWordC#`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-prim-0.5.3/docs/GHC-Prim.html#v:addWordC-35-) returns `(result, carry)`
- [`PlusWordC#`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-prim-0.5.3/docs/GHC-Prim.html#v:plusWord-35-) returns `(carry, result)`

Honestly, this is confusing, but I guess there's some story to having two separate primops for this?

# Everything you know about word2vec is wrong.

The classic explanation of `word2vec`, in skip-gram, with negative sampling,
in the paper and countless blog posts on the internet is as follows:

```
while(1) {
   1. vf = vector of focus word
   2. vc = vector of context word
   3. train such that (vc . vf = 1)
   4. for(0 <= i < negative samples):
           vneg = vector of word *not* in context
           train such that (vf . vneg = 0)
}
```

Indeed, if I google "word2vec skipgram", the results I get are:
- [The wikipedia page which describes the algorithm on a high level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec#Training_algorithm)
- [The tensorflow page with the same explanation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/representation/word2vec)
- [The towards data science blog which describes the same algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/word2vec-skip-gram-model-part-1-intuition-78614e4d6e0b)
the list goes on. However, __every single one of these implementations is wrong__.

The original word2vec `C` implementation does _not_ do what's explained above,
and is _drastically different_. Most serious users of word embeddings, who use
embeddings generated from `word2vec` do one of the following things:

1. They invoke the original C implementation directly.
2. They invoke the `gensim` implementation, which is _transliterated_ from the
   C source to the extent that the variables names are the same.

Indeed, the `gensim` implementation is the _only one that I know of which 
is faithful to the C implementation_.

### The C implementation

The C implementation in fact maintains _two vectors for each word_, one where
it appears as a focus word, and one where it appears as a context word. 
(Is this sounding familiar? Indeed, it appears that GloVe actually took this
idea from `word2vec`, which has never mentioned this fact!)

The setup is incredibly well done in the C code:

- An array called `syn0` holds the vector embedding of a word when it occurs
as a _focus word_. This is __random initialized__. 

```cpp
https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec/blob/20c129af10659f7c50e86e3be406df663beff438/word2vec.c#L369
  for (a = 0; a < vocab_size; a++) for (b = 0; b < layer1_size; b++) {
    next_random = next_random * (unsigned long long)25214903917 + 11;
    syn0[a * layer1_size + b] = 
       (((next_random & 0xFFFF) / (real)65536) - 0.5) / layer1_size;
  }

```

- Another array called `syn1neg` holds the vector of a word when it occurs
as a _context word_. This is __zero initialized__.

```cpp
https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec/blob/20c129af10659f7c50e86e3be406df663beff438/word2vec.c#L365
for (a = 0; a < vocab_size; a++) for (b = 0; b < layer1_size; b++)
  syn1neg[a * layer1_size + b] = 0;
```

- During training (skip-gram, negative sampling, though other cases are 
also similar), we first pick a focus word. This is held constant throughout
the positive and negative sample training. The gradients of the focus vector
are accumulated in a buffer, and are applied to the focus word 
_after it has been affected by both positive and negative samples_.

```cpp
if (negative > 0) for (d = 0; d < negative + 1; d++) {
  // if we are performing negative sampling, in the 1st iteration,
  // pick a word from the context and set the dot product target to 1
  if (d == 0) {
    target = word;
    label = 1;
  } else {
    // for all other iterations, pick a word randomly and set the dot
    //product target to 0
    next_random = next_random * (unsigned long long)25214903917 + 11;
    target = table[(next_random >> 16) % table_size];
    if (target == 0) target = next_random % (vocab_size - 1) + 1;
    if (target == word) continue;
    label = 0;
  }
  l2 = target * layer1_size;
  f = 0;

  // find dot product of original vector with negative sample vector
  // store in f
  for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) f += syn0[c + l1] * syn1neg[c + l2];

  // set g = sigmoid(f) (roughly, the actual formula is slightly more complex)
  if (f > MAX_EXP) g = (label - 1) * alpha;
  else if (f < -MAX_EXP) g = (label - 0) * alpha;
  else g = (label - expTable[(int)((f + MAX_EXP) * (EXP_TABLE_SIZE / MAX_EXP / 2))]) * alpha;

  // 1. update the vector syn1neg,
  // 2. DO NOT UPDATE syn0
  // 3. STORE THE syn0 gradient in a temporary buffer neu1e
  for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) neu1e[c] += g * syn1neg[c + l2];
  for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) syn1neg[c + l2] += g * syn0[c + l1];
}
// Finally, after all samples, update syn1 from neu1e
https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec/blob/20c129af10659f7c50e86e3be406df663beff438/word2vec.c#L541
// Learn weights input -> hidden
for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) syn0[c + l1] += neu1e[c];
```

### Why random and zero initialization?

Once again, since none of this actually explained in the original papers
_or on the web_, I can only hypothesize.

My hypothesis is that since the negative samples come from all over the text
and are not really weighed by frequency, you can wind up picking _any word_,
and more often than not, _a word whose vector has not been trained much at all_.
If this vector actually had a value, then it could move the actually important
focus word randomly. 

The solution is to set all negative samples to zero, so that _only vectors
that have occurred somewhat frequently_ will affect the representation of
another vector.

It's quite ingenious, really, and until this, I'd never really thought of
how important initialization strategies really are.


### Why I'm writing this

I spent two months of my life trying to reproduce `word2vec`, following
the paper exactly, reading countless articles, and simply not succeeding.
I was unable to reach the same scores that `word2vec` did, and it was not
for lack of trying.

I could not have imagined that the paper would have literally fabricated an
algorithm that doesn't work, while the implementation does something completely
different.

Eventually, I decided to read the sources, and spent three whole days convinced
I was reading the code wrong since literally everything on the internet told me
otherwise.

I don't understand why the original paper and the internet contain zero
explanations of the _actual_ mechanism behind `word2vec`, so I decided to put
it up myself.

This also explains GloVe's radical choice of having a separate vector
for the negative context --- they were just doing what `word2vec` does, but
they told people about it `:)`.

Is this academic dishonesty? I don't know the answer, and that's a heavy
question. But I'm frankly incredibly pissed, and this is probably the last
time I take a machine learning paper's explanation of the algorithm
seriously again --- from next time, I read the source _first_. 

# Hamiltonian monte carlo, leapfrog integrators, and sympletic geometry

This is a section that I'll update as I learn more about the space, since I'm studying
differential geometry over the summer, I hope to know enough about "sympletic manifolds".
I'll make this an append-only log to add to the section as I understand more.

##### 31st May

- To perform hamiltonian monte carlo, we use the hamiltonian and its derivatives to provide
a momentum to our proposal distribution --- That is, when we choose a new point from the
current point, our probability distribution for the new point is influenced by our
current momentum

- For some integral necessary within this scheme, Euler integration doesn't cut it 
since the error diverges to infinity

- Hence, we need an integrator that guarantees that the energy of out system is conserved.
Enter the leapfrog integrator. This integrator is also _time reversible_ -- We can run it
forward for `n` steps, and then run it backward for `n` steps to arrive at the same state.
Now I finally know how Braid was implemented, something that bugged the hell out of 9th grade me
when I tried to implement Braid-like physics in my engine!

- The actual derivation of the integrator uses Lie algebras, Sympletic geometry, and other
diffgeo ideas, which is great, because it gives me motivation to study differential geometry `:)`

- Original paper: [Construction of higher order sympletic integrators](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0375960190900923)

# Small Haskell MCMC implementation:

We create a simple monad called `PL` which allows for a single operation: sampling
from a uniform distribution. We then exploit this to implement MCMC using metropolis hastings,
which is used to sample from arbitrary distributions. Bonus is a small library to render sparklines
in the CLI.

For next time:

- Using applicative to speed up computations by exploiting parallelism
- Conditioning of a distribution wrt a variable

Yeah, in ~80 lines of code, you can basically build an autograd engine. Isn't
haskell so rad?


# Timings of passes in GHC, and low hanging fruit in the backend:

- One can use `-v3` to get pass timings.
- Apparently, GHC spends a lot of time in the simplifier, and time
  spend in the backend is peanuts in comparison to this.
- To quote `AndreasK`:
> - Register allocation, common block elimination, block layout and pretty printing are the "slow" things in the backend as far as I remember.
> - There are also a handful of TODO's in the x86 codegen which still apply. So you can try to grep for these.
> - Strength reduction for division by a constant

# Varargs in GHC: `ghc/testsuite/tests/rts/T7160.hs`

A comment from this test case tells us why the function `debugBelch2` exists:

```hs
ghc/testsuite/tests/rts/T7160.hs
-- Don't use debugBelch() directly, because we cannot call varargs functions
-- using the FFI (doing so produces a segfault on 64-bit Linux, for example).
-- See Debug.Trace.traceIO, which also uses debugBelch2.
foreign import ccall "&debugBelch2" fun :: FunPtr (Ptr () -> Ptr () -> IO ())
```

The implementation is:

```c
ghc/libraries/base/cbits/PrelIOUtils.c

void debugBelch2(const char*s, char *t)
{
    debugBelch(s,t);
}
```

```
ghc/rts/RtsMessages.c

RtsMsgFunction *debugMsgFn  = rtsDebugMsgFn;
...

void
debugBelch(const char*s, ...)
{
  va_list ap;
  va_start(ap,s);
  (*debugMsgFn)(s,ap);
  va_end(ap);
}
```
# Debugging debug info in GHC: [Link](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/blob/535a26c90f458801aeb1e941a3f541200d171e8f/compiler/cmm/Debug.hs#L458)

I wanted to use debug info to help build a better debugging experience
within [`tweag/asterius`](http://github.com/tweag/asterius). So, I was 
reading through the sources of `cmm/Debug.hs`.  
I'd never considered how to debug debug-info, and I found the information
tucked inside a cute note in GHC (`Note [Debugging DWARF unwinding info]`):

# How does GHC `show` a `Float`?

Turns out the implementation uses a cool paper:

> Printing float point numbers fast and accurately

##### `class Show`:

First, let's review the `Show` typeclass:

```hs
class Show a where
    showsPrec :: Int    -- ^ the operator precedence of the enclosing
                        -- context (a number from @0@ to @11@).
                        -- Function application has precedence @10@.
              -> a      -- ^ the value to be converted to a 'String'
              -> ShowS

    -- | A specialised variant of 'showsPrec', using precedence context
    -- zero, and returning an ordinary 'String'.
    show      :: a   -> String
    ... 
    show x          = shows x ""

-- | equivalent to 'showsPrec' with a precedence of 0.
shows           :: (Show a) => a -> ShowS
shows           =  showsPrec 0
```
So, note that all we need to do is to define `showsPrec`, and `show`
gets defined as `show x = showsPrec 0 x ""`

##### `instance Show Float`:

```hs
instance  Show Float  where
    showsPrec   x = showSignedFloat showFloat x
```

##### `showSignedFloat`:

`showSignedFloat` is a combinator to care of printing signs:

```hs
showSignedFloat :: (RealFloat a)
  => (a -> ShowS)       -- ^ a function that can show unsigned values
  -> Int                -- ^ the precedence of the enclosing context
  -> a                  -- ^ the value to show
  -> ShowS
showSignedFloat showPos p x
   | x < 0 || isNegativeZero x
       = showParen (p > 6) (showChar '-' . showPos (-x))
   | otherwise = showPos x
```

##### `showFloat`:

the `showFloat` is the function that is able to show a float as an
unsigned value.


```hs
showFloat :: (RealFloat a) => a -> ShowS
showFloat x  =  showString (formatRealFloat FFGeneric Nothing x)
```

```hs
-- | utility function converting a 'String' to a show function that
-- simply prepends the string unchanged.
showString      :: String -> ShowS
showString      =  (++)
```

##### `formatRealFloat`:

```hs
formatRealFloat :: (RealFloat a) => FFFormat -> Maybe Int -> a -> String
formatRealFloat fmt decs x = formatRealFloatAlt fmt decs False x

formatRealFloatAlt :: (RealFloat a) => FFFormat -> Maybe Int -> Bool -> a
                 -> String
formatRealFloatAlt fmt decs alt x
   | isNaN x                   = "NaN"
   | isInfinite x              = if x < 0 then "-Infinity" else "Infinity"
   | x < 0 || isNegativeZero x = '-':doFmt fmt (floatToDigits (toInteger base) (-x))

# GHC LLVM code generator: Switch to unreachable

The [switch to out of range](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/blob/master/compiler/llvmGen/LlvmCodeGen/CodeGen.hs#L1102) 
code generator switches to the first label. It should be more profitable
to switch to a `unreachable` block. That way, LLVM can take advantage of UB.

# Concurrency in Haskell:

Great link to the GHC wiki that describes the concurrency primitives
"bottom up": https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/lightweight-concurrency

# Handy list of differential geometry definitions

There are way too many objects in diffgeo, all of them subtly connected.
Here I catalogue all of the ones I have run across:

##### Manifold

A manifold `M` of dimension `n` is a topological space. So, there is a
topological structure `T` on `M`. There is also an `Atlas`, which is a family
of `Chart`s that satisfy some properties.

##### Chart

A chart is a pair `(O ∈  T , cm: O -> R^n)`. The `O` is an open set of the
manifold, and `cm`("chart for "m") is a continuous mapping from `O` to `R^n`
under the subspace topology for `U` and the standard topology for `R^n`.

#####  Atlas

An `Atlas` is a collection of `Charts` such that the charts cover the manifold,
and the charts are pairwise compatible. That is, `A = { (U_i, phi_i)}`, such
that `union of U_i = M`, and `phi_j . inverse (phi_i)` is smooth.

##### Differentiable map

`f: M -> N` be a mapping from an `m` dimensional manifold to an `n` dimensional
manifold. Let `frep = cn . f . inverse (cm): R^m -> R^n` where `cm: M -> R^m`
is a chart for `M`, `cn: N -> R^n` is a chart for `N`.`frep` is `f` represented
in local coordinates. If `frep` is smooth for all choices of `cm` and `cn`,
then `f` is a differentiable map from `M` to `N`.

##### Curve: 

Let `I` be an open interval of `R` which includes the point `0`.  A Curve is a
differentiable map `C: (a, b) -> M` where `a < 0 < b`.

##### Function: (I hate this term, I prefer something like Valuation): 

A differentiable mapping from `M` to `R`.


##### Directional derivative of a function `f(m): M -> R` with respect to a curve `c(t): I -> M`, denoted as `c[f]`.

Let `g(t) = (f . c)(t) :: I -c-> M -f-> R = I -> R`.
This this is the value `dg/dt(t0) = (d (f . c) / dt) (0)`.

##### Tangent vector at a point `p`:

On a `m` dimensional manifold `M`, a tangent vector at a point `p` is an
equivalence class of curves that have `c(0) = p`, such that `c1(t) ~ c2(t)` iff
:

2. For a (all) charts `(O, ch)` such that `c1(0) ∈  O`,
 `d/dt (ch . c1: R -> R^m) = d/dt (ch . c2: R -> R^m)`.

 That is, they have equal derivatives.

##### Tangent space(`TpM`):

The set of all tangent vectors at a point `p` forms a vector space `TpM`.
We prove this by creating a bijection from every curve to a vector `R^n`.

Let `(U, ch: U -> R)` be a chart around the point `p`, where `p ∈ U ⊆ M`. Now,
the bijection is defined as:

```
forward: (I -> M) -> R^n
forward(c) = d/dt (c . ch)

reverse: R^n -> (I -> M)
reverse(v)(t) = ch^-1 (tv)
```

##### Cotangent space(`TpM*`): dual space of the tangent space / Space of all linear functions from `TpM` to `R`.

- Associated to every function `f`, there is a cotangent vector, colorfully
  called `df`. The definition is `df: TpM -> R`, `df(c: I -> M) = c[f]`. That is,
  given a curve `c`, we take the directional derivative of the function `f`
  along the curve `c`. We need to prove that this is constant for all vectors
  in the equivalence class and blah.

######  Pushforward `push(f): TpM -> TpN`

Given a curve `c: I -> M`, the pushforward
is the curve `f . c : I -> N`. This extends to the equivalence classes
and provides us a way to move curves in `M` to curves in `N`, and thus
gives us a mapping from the tangent spaces.

This satisfies the identity:

```
push(f)(v)[g] === v[g . f]
```

##### Pullback `pull(f): TpN* -> TpM*`

Given a linear functional `wn : TpN -> R`, the pullback is defined as
` wn . push(f) : TpM -> R`.


This satisfies the identity:

```
(pull wn)(v) === wn (push v)
(pull (wn : TpN->R): TpM->R) (v : TpM) : R  = (wn: TpN->R) (push (v: TpM): TpN) : R
```

##### Vector field as derivation

TODO

##### Lie derivation

##### Lie derivation as lie bracket




## Lazy programs have space leaks, Strict programs have time leaks
Stumbled across this idea while reading some posts on a private discourse.
- Continually adding new thunks without forcing them can lead to a space leak,
  aka the dreaded monadic parsing backtracking problem.

- Continually _running_ new thunks can lead to a "time leak", where we spend
  far too much time running things that should not be run in the first place!

This is an interesting perspective that I've never seen articulated before, and
somehow helps make space leaks feel more... palatable? Before, I had no
analogue to a space leak in the strict world, so I saw them as a pathology. But
with this new perspective, I can see that the strict world's version of a space
leak is a time leak.

## Presburger arithmetic can represent the Collatz Conjecture

An observation I had: the function

```
f(x) = x/2      if (x % 2 == 0)
f(x) = 3x + 1   otherwise
```

is a Presburger function, so by building better approximations to the
transitive closure of a presburger function, one could get better answers
to the Collatz conjecture. Unfortunately, ISL (the integer set library) of today
is not great against the formidable foe.

The code:

```
#include <isl/set.h>
#include <isl/version.h>
#include <isl/map.h>
#include <isl/aff.h>
#include <isl/local_space.h>
#include <isl/constraint.h>
#include <isl/space.h>

int main() {
    isl_ctx *ctx = isl_ctx_alloc();
    const char *s = "{ [x] -> [x / 2] : x % 2 = 0; [x] -> [3 * x + 1] : x % 2 = 1}";

    isl_map *m = isl_map_read_from_str(ctx, s);

    isl_map_dump(m);

    isl_bool b;
    isl_map *p = isl_map_transitive_closure(m, &b);
    printf("exact: %d\n", b);
    printf("map:\n");
    isl_map_dump(p);

}
```

Produces the somewhat disappointing, and yet expected output:

```
$ clang bug.c -lisl -Lisl-0.20/.libs -o bug -I/usr/local/include/
$ ./bug
{ [x] -> [o0] : 2o0 = x or (exists (e0 = floor((1 + x)/2): o0 = 1 + 3x and 2e0 = 1 + x)) }
exact: 0
map:
{ [x] -> [o0] }
```

I find it odd that it is unable to prove _anything_ about the image, even that
it is non-negative, for example. This is an interesting direction in which
to improve the functions `isl_map_power` and `isl_map_transitive_closure`
though.


## Using compactness to argue about the cover in an argument

I've always seen compactness be used by _starting_ with a possibly infinite
coverm and then _filtering it_ into a finite subcover. This finite
subcover is then used for finiteness properties (like summing, min, max, etc.).

I recently ran across a use of compactness when one _starts_ with the set
of _all possible subcovers_, and then argues about why a cover cannot be built
from these subcovers if the set is compact. I found it to be a very cool
use of compactness, which I'll record below:

##### Theorem: 

If a family of compact, countably infinite sets `S_a` have all 
_finite intersections_ non-empty, then the intersection of the family `S_a`
is non-empty.

##### Proof:

Let `S = intersection of S_a`. We know that `S` must be compact since
all the `S_a` are compact, and the intersection of a countably infinite
number of compact sets is compact.

Now, let `S` be empty. Therefore, this means there must be a point `p ∈ P`
such that `p !∈ S_i` for some arbitrary `i`.

##### Cool use of theorem:

We can see that the cantor set is non-empty, since it contains a family
of closed and bounded sets `S1, S2, S3, ...` such that  `S1 ⊇ S2 ⊇ S3 ...`
where each `S_i` is one step of the cantor-ification. We can now see
that the cantor set is non-empty, since:

1. Each finite intersection is non-empty, and will be equal to the set that
   has the highest index in the finite intersection.

2. Each of the sets `Si` are compact since they are closed and bounded subsets of `R`

3. Invoke theorem.

## Stephen wolfram's live stream
- [Twitch.tv link](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/408653972)


I've taken to watching the live stream when I have some downtime and want
some interesting content. 

The discussions of Wolfram with his group are great, and they bring up
_really_ interesting ideas (like that of cleave being very irregular).

## `Cleave` as a word has some of the most irregular inflections

## McCune's single axiom for group theory
[Single Axioms for Groups and Abelian Groups with Various
Operations](http://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/tech_reports/reports/P270.pdf)
provides a single axiom for groups. This can be useful for some ideas I have
for training groups, where we can use this axiom as the loss function!

## `Word2Vec` C code implements gradient descent really weirdly
I'll be posting snippets of the original source code, along with a 
link to the Github sources. We are interested in exploring the skip-gram
implementation of Word2Vec, with negative sampling, without hierarchical
softmax. I assume basic familiarity with word embeddings and the skip-gram
model.

#### Construction of the sigmoid lookup table
```cpp
// https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L708

expTable = (real *)malloc((EXP_TABLE_SIZE + 1) * sizeof(real));
for (i = 0; i < EXP_TABLE_SIZE; i++) {
  expTable[i] = exp((i / (real)EXP_TABLE_SIZE * 2 - 1) *
                    MAX_EXP);  // Precompute the exp() table
  expTable[i] =
      expTable[i] / (expTable[i] + 1);  // Precompute f(x) = x / (x + 1)
}
```
Here, the code constructs a lookup table which maps `[0...EXP_TABLE_SIZE-1]`
to `[sigmoid(-MAX_EXP)...sigmoid(MAX_EXP)]`. The index `i` first gets mapped
to `(i / EXP_TABLE_SIZE) * 2 - 1`, which sends `0` to `-1` and `EXP_TABLE_SIZE`
to `1`. This is then rescaled by `MAX_EXP`.

#### Layer initialization

- `syn0` is a global variable, initialized with random weights in the range of
`[-0.5...0.5]`. It has dimensions `VOCAB x HIDDEN`.  This layer holds the
hidden representations of word vectors.

```cpp
// https://github.com/imsky/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L341
a = posix_memalign((void **)&syn0, 128,
               (long long)vocab_size * layer1_size * sizeof(real));
...

// https://github.com/imsky/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L355
for (a = 0; a < vocab_size; a++)
        for (b = 0; b < layer1_size; b++) {
            next_random = next_random * (unsigned long long)25214903917 + 11;
            syn0[a * layer1_size + b] =
                (((next_random & 0xFFFF) / (real)65536) - 0.5) / layer1_size;
        }
```


- `syn1neg` is a global variable that is zero-initialized. It has dimensions
`VOCAB x HIDDEN`. This layer also holds hidden representations of word vectors,
_when they are used as a negative sample_.

```cpp
// https://github.com/imsky/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L350
a = posix_memalign((void **)&syn1neg, 128,
                   (long long)vocab_size * layer1_size * sizeof(real));
...
for (a = 0; a < vocab_size; a++)
    for (b = 0; b < layer1_size; b++) syn1neg[a * layer1_size + b] = 0;
```

- `neu1e` is a temporary per-thread buffer (Remember that the `word2vec` C code
use CPU threads for parallelism) which is zero initialized. It has dimensions
`1 x HIDDEN`.

```cpp
// https://github.com/imsky/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L370
real *neu1e = (real *)calloc(layer1_size, sizeof(real));
```

#### Backpropogation

Throughout `word2vec`, no 2D arrays are used. Indexing of the form
`arr[word][ix]` is manually written as `arr[word * layer1_size + ix]`. So, I
will call `word * layer1_size` as the "base address", and `ix` as the "offset
of the array index expression henceforth.

Here, `l1` is the base address of the word at the center of window (the focus
word).  `l2` is the base address of either the word that is negative sampled
from the corpus, or the word that is a positive sample from within the context
window.

`label` tells us whether the sample is a positive or a negative sample. 
`label = 1` for positive samples, and `label = 0` for negative samples.

```cpp
// zero initialize neu1e
// https://github.com/imsky/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L419
for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) neu1e[c] = 0;
...
// loop through each negative sample
// https://github.com/imsky/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L508
if (negative > 0)  for (d = 0; d < negative + 1; d++) {
  ...
  // https://github.com/imsky/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L521
  // take the dot product: f=  syn0[focus] . syn1neg[context]
  for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) f += syn0[c + l1] * syn1neg[c + l2];
  
  // compute: g = (label - sigmoid(2f - 1)) * alpha
  // g is computed using lookups into a lookup table and clamping for
  // efficiency.
  if (f > MAX_EXP) g = (label - 1) * alpha;
  else if (f < -MAX_EXP) g = (label - 0) * alpha;
  else
  g = (label - expTable[(int)((f + MAX_EXP) *
                              (EXP_TABLE_SIZE /
                               MAX_EXP / 2))]) * alpha;
  // Now that we have computed the gradient:
  // `g = (label - output) * learningrate`,
  // we need to perform backprop. This is where the code gets weird.

  for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) neu1e[c] += g * syn1neg[c + l2];
  for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) syn1neg[c + l2] += g * syn0[c + l1];
  } // end loop through negative samples
// Learn weights input -> hidden
for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) syn0[c + l1] += neu1e[c];
```

- We have _two_ vectors for each word, one called `syn0[l1 + _]` and 
the other `syn1neg[l2 + _]`. The `syn1neg` word embedding is used whenever
a word is used a negative sample, and is not used anywhere else. Also,
the `syn1neg` vector is zero initialized, while the `syn0` vectors are
randomly initialized.

- The values we backprop with `g * syn1neg[l2 + _]`, `g * syn0[l1 + _]` are
  _not_ the correct gradients of the error term! The derivative of a sigmoid
  is `dsigmoid(x)/dx = sigmoid(x) [1 - sigmoid(x)]`. The `[1 - sigmoid(x)]`
  is nowhere to be seen, let alone the fact that we are using 
  `sigmoid(2x - 1)` and not regular sigmoid. Very weird.

- We hold the value of `syn0` constant throughout all the negative samples,
which was not mentioned in any tutorial I've read.

The paper does not mentioned these implementation details, and neither
does _any blog post that I've read_. I don't understand what's going on,
and I plan on updating this section when I understand this better.


## Arthur Whitney: dense code
- Guy who wrote a bunch of APL dialects, write code in an eclectic style
  that has very little whitespace and single letter variable names.
- Believes that this allows him to hold the entire program in his head.
- Seems legit from my limited experience with APL, haskell one-liners.
- [The b programming language](http://kparc.com/b/readme.txt). It's quite 
  awesome to read the sources. For example, [`a.c`](http://kparc.com/b/a.c)
## How does one work with arrays in a linear language?

Given an array of qubits `xs: Qubit[]`, I want to switch to little endian.
Due to no-cloning, I can't copy them! I suppose I can use recursion to build
up a new "list". But this is not the efficient array version we know and love
and want. 

The code that I want to work but does not:
```csharp
function switchEndian(xs: Qubit[]): Unit {
    for(i in 0..Length(xs) - 1) {
        Qubit q = xs[i]; // boom, this does not work!
        xs[i] = xs[Length(xs) - 1 - i]
        xs[Length(xs) - 1 - i] = q;
    }
}
```

On the other hand, what _does work_ is to setup a quantum circuit that
performs this flipping, since it's a permutation matrix at the end of
the day. But this is very slow, since it needs to simulate the "quantumness"
of the solution, since it takes `2^n` basis vectors for `n` qubits. 

However, the usual recursion based solution works:
```csharp
function switchEndian(xs: Qubit[]): Qubit[] {
    if(Length(xs) == 1) {
        return xs;
    } else {
        switchEndian(xs[1..(Length(xs) - 1)] + xs[0]
    }
}
```

This is of course, suboptimal.

I find it interesting that in the linear types world, often the "pure" solution
is _forced_ since mutation very often involves temporaries / copying!

(I'm solving assignments in [qsharp](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/)
for my course in college)

## How Linear optimisation is the same as Linear feasibility checking
Core building block of effectively using the ellipsoid algorithm.

- If we posess a way to check if a point `p ∈ P` where `P` is a polytope, we
  can use this to solve optimisation problems.
- Given the optimisation problem maximise `c^Tx` subject to `Ax = b`, we can
  construct a new _non-emptiness_ problem. This allows us to convert optimisation
  into _feasibility_.
- The new problem is `Ax = b, A^Ty = c, c^Tx = b^T y`. Note that by duality,
  a point in this new polyhedra will _be an optimal solution to the above linear program_.
  We are forcing `c^Tx = b^Ty`, which will be the optimal solution, since the
  solution where the primal and dual agree is the optimal solution by strong
  duality.
- This way, we have converted a _linear programming_ problem into a 
  _check if this polytope is empty_ problem!

## Quantum computation without complex numbers
I recently learnt that the Toeffili and Hadamard gates are universal for
quantum computation. The description of these gates involve no complex numbers.
So, we can write any quantum circuit in a "complex number free" form. The caveat
is that we may very well have _input qubits_ that require complex numbers.

Even so, a large number (all?) of the basic algorithms shown in Nielsen and
Chaung can be encoded in an entirely complex-number free fashion.

I don't really understand the ramifications of this, since I had the intuition
that the power of quantum computation comes from the ability to express
complex phases along with superposition (tensoring). However, I now have
to remove the power from going from R to C in many cases. This is definitely
something to ponder.
